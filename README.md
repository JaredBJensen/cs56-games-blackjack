Blackjack games

In this directory, you will find several subdirectories.

* main contains the "main" branch of development for the CS56
  blackjack project.  At the start of S13, this is simply an empty
  shell.  If you choose to take on this project, your job is to look
  at all of the other subdirectories below, and either (a) improve one
  of those, or (b) build a brand new game in this directory, pulling
  the "best pieces" from those other attempts.

Each of the other subdirectories contains code for a blackjack game
developed by previous CS56 students.  Each of those subdirectories has
its own README.md file that explains where that game came from, and
what the next steps for that game might be.
